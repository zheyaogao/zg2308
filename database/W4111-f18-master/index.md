# W4111-Fall-2018: Introduction to Databases

This GitHub repository supports the Dept. of Computer Science, Columbia University course
_COMSW4111 - Section 01 and H01 - Fall 2018: Introduction to Databases_

## Overview

This section of Introduction to Databases focuses understanding and applying database technology, and deemphasizes the theory and algorithms.
The course will cover underlying theory and algorithms but in less detail than other database classes.
The course will have ten sections divided into four core modules. Specific topics will often appear in more than
one section of a module and across modules. For example, understanding data modeling and best practices and data schema/query are intertwined.
The outline below is an overview and explains the main content flow, but content will vary in lectures.

The course work will include:

- 5 individually completed 10 point implementation projects. There will be a project assignment approximately every other week.
- 20 point take home midterm that will involve simple coding and answering questions.
- 30 point take home final that will involve simple coding and answering questions.
- Class and office hours participation.

## Course Schedule

### Module I: Foundational Concepts

1. Introduction to databases, role in applications, type of DB applications and overall system software architecture.

2. Information and data modeling and best practices, focusing on supporting application scenarios.

3. Relational data model (theory), Relational Database Management Systems, Structured Query Language, data query and update scenarios.

4. Extended topics in SQL and RDBMS (performance, security, constraints, triggers, connection management, etc).

 Module II: Database Management System Implementation/Architecture

5. Storage management, disk management, buffer management, indexes.

6. Query processing and optimization:  Query evaluation, query parsing and parse trees, operator implementation algorithms, query rewrite, query optimization techniques.

7. Concurrency control and transaction management.

 Module III: NoSQL Database Overview

8. Overview, graph databases, Redis.

9. Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Google Firebase/Cloud Firestore.

 Module IV: Decision Support, Data Analysis

10. Overview of schema denormalization, OLAP cubes, data analytics, machine learning.
