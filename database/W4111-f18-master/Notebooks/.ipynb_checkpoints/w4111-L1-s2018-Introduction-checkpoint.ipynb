    "“Data modeling (data modelling) is the analysis of data objects and their relationships to other data objects. Data modeling is often the first step in database design and object-oriented programming as the designers first create a conceptual model of how data items relate to each other. Data modeling involves a progression from conceptual model to logical model to physical schema.” (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/data_modeling.html)\n",
